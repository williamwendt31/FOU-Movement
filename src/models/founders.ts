The FOU Movement started from a daily devotional with a few USOs I knew from the streets and met in prison. Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 3:6, 'I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.' So from a daily devotional, God gave the increase and hence the F.O.U Movement was born. A Gathering of Brothers reaching back into the communities we once damaged and now sublimating our energy to fix those wrongs through our Experience, Strength and Hope. Revelation 12:11 says 'And we defeat him [devil] by the Blood of the Lamb and through the words of our Testimony.' Excited to see how God is going to use us to do HIS bidding and HIS work here on earth. Do everything humanly possible to get ourselves together and Pray God does the rest. Alofa Atu"

I also want to give back to our community and help our brothers and sisters make better choices from what we had growing up. I met these group of men while being incarcerated. We grew a bond that only we understand, since we came from so many different backgrounds. These group of men and myself want to make a change for the better of our Polynesian people.

I joined The F.O.U Movement because for one point of my life I want to see change. I want to see peace in my Polynesian communities. So for those reasons I joined a one of a kind movement. The F.O.U Movement is something special. We were all former enemies at one point on these gang infested Southern California streets. We all made an oath for peace and change. Not only do I want a safer and better way of life for my own children, but I also want the same chance for our own Polynesian youth in our communities that I once terrorized at one point in my life. For That I Am F.O.U!"

It’s from here that I ended up hanging around other Samoans, who were relatives and others who were family friends, but all were gang members. During this time, I ended being arrested on three different occasions, wasting 5, 7, and finally 13 years of my life. It wasn’t until my final term that I finally decided, 'enough is enough' and 'I am done.' The reason I wanted to change my life and help change the lives of others in my similar situation is because I forgot what being William was like. What being Uso was about. Today, I remember and want to give back to my community by educating the youth through mentoring and volunteer work. If I can help just one kid avoid prison or death because of gangs or drugs, then I’ll have kept my promise to myself and my family to not only change myself, but also help others seeking change too."

It took a life sentence at 15 years old and 30 years of my life serving it to understand that who I was, was not who God intended me to be: The Son, Brother, Husband, Father, Uncle, Grandfather and Friend He made me uniquely to be. It is my goal in life to inspire others, especially our youth, with my testimony."
